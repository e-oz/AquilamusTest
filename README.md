This project was made for test case from Aquilamus and for my own self-learning process.  
Here you can see usage of Angular Material and ES6, bleeding edge technologies with best Angular yet - 1.3   
API of server is not under my control, but in this project more important part is demonstration of possibilities: usage ES6 and Angular Material already now.  
It runs, builds and tests passing - working code.
